## How can I contribute?

### Filing a bug report

If you discovered a bug that no one else has reported in our [issues backlog](https://github.com/uswds/web-components/issues), let us know by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/uswds/web-components/issues/new). We're in active work on this beta and may not be able to respond immediately, but we'll get to it as soon as as we can.

### Starting a discussion

To share ideas, questions, or concerns with the USWDS core team and community, you can join any of our [open discussions](https://github.com/uswds/web-components/discussions) or [start a new one](https://github.com/uswds/web-components/discussions/new/choose).

### Submitting a pull request

In this repo, we're not accepting code contributions from the community yet. We expect to open up community pull request submissions in early 2025, so check back later for more info on how to contribute pull requests to USWDS Web Components.
