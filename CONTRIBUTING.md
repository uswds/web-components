## How can I contribute?

### Filing a bug report

If you have discovered a bug that has not yet been reported in our [issues backlog](https://github.com/uswds/web-components/issues), let us know by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/uswds/web-components/issues/new). We are in beta and may not be able to respond immediately, but we will address as soon as as we are able.

### Starting a discussion

If you want to share ideas, questions, or concerns with the USWDS core team and community, you can participate in any of our [open discussions](https://github.com/uswds/web-components/discussions) or [start a new discussion](https://github.com/uswds/web-components/discussions/new/choose).

### Submitting a pull request

At this time, we are not accepting code contributions from the community. We expect to open up community pull request submissions in early 2025, so check back later for instructions on how to contribute pull requests to USWDS web components.
